## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

I learned how to set dataset active in Javascript as an indicator that the item will be shown. It is a bit tricky but I manage to show image when user click next or select thumbnail. I learned how to utilize DOM. Adding items is also one thing I learn and tracking how many items added.  


### Continued development

Vanilla Javascript is still a challenge for me. I am struggling in building the lightbox and image slider. The best way for me to learn is to code everyday and understand how thing works especially in manipulating DOM, arrays and datasets.
